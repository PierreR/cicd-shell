# CICD shell

## Quick first time setup

### AD permissions

The permissions to target machines and perform actions are realized through our Active directory. As an example to access the machines of the `middleware` hostgroup, you will need to be part of the `GP_APP_SALT_MIDDLEWARE` group.


### Softwares

If you use the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/README.md#devbox[devbox], everything is already bundled, so you might just skip this section.

Otherwise, the requirements are:

* git
* nix

If you haven't installed `nix` already, here is the quick how to:

```
bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```
This will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that /nix is owned by the invoking user. The script will only invoke `sudo` to create /nix if it doesn’t already exist. At that point, the script will prompt you for a password.

To activate `nix` in your shell, add the following line in your `.bash_profile`:

```
source ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh'
```

You will also need to fetch the `nixpkgs` source for https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/config.nix including the `pkgs` folder.


## Usage

### command line

The name of the command line utility is #cicd#. The first mandatory position argument is the zone (dev, testing, staging or prod):

Here are some examples:

```
→ cicd prod stack ping
→ cicd prod stack facts
→ cicd staging node data svappcavl703.sta.srv.cirb.lan
→ cicd staging node du svappcavl703.sta.srv.cirb.lan
→ cicd staging node run-puppet --init svappcavl703.sta.srv.cirb.lan
→ cicd testing result -n 2
```

You can request the help at each level. For instance:
```
→ cicd -h <1>
→ cicd ZONE stack
→ cicd ZONE stack orch 
→ cicd ZONE node
→ cicd ZONE node run-puppet
→ cicd ZONE result
```
<1> you can omit `-h`


[NOTE]
- These commands are executed remotely (if you have the right to execute them) through an API. Behind the scene they might call either the `puppetdb` or the `saltmaster`. For instance `cicd ZONE node facts NODE` would call the puppetdb and return a result even when the node is down. 

- All commands to the saltmaster together with their results are recorded in a centralize database included the date and name of the person that execute them.


### The specialized shell

.Open a specialized #console in staging#
```
→ cicd staging console
```

One great feature of this specialized shell is the *automatic completion* (while typing) of the available nodes, commands, ... It acts as an interactive help to ease the task at hand.

#### examples

- Summary of all machines and a selection of interesting facts about them:
```
$ facts
{
  "fqdn": "svappcavl703.sta.srv.cirb.lan",
  "ip": "192.168.22.250",
  "os": "CentOS 7.2.1511",
  "subgroup": "",
  "role": "saltmaster"
}
```

- Run puppet via the `pep` alias on two nodes:
```
pep -L foreman.sandbox.srv.cirb.lan,puppetdb.sandbox.srv.cirb.lan --client=local_async puppetutils.run_agent
```

- Disk usage on a node:
```
$ du-on svappcavl088.sta.srv.cirb.lan
{
  "svappcavl088.sta.srv.cirb.lan": {
    "/": "23%",
    "/boot": "69%",
    "/data": "51%",
    "/dev/shm": "1%",
    "/home": "19%",
    "/tmp": "35%",
    "/usr": "44%",
    "/var": "74%",
    "/var/log": "4%"
  }
}
```

#### available commands

* `stack_ping`: ping all nodes within your stack
* `stack_facts`: some facts on all machines within your stack
* `stack_orchestrate`: launch an orchestration script
* `node_facts`: all static information available on a specific node
* `node_runpuppet` n: run puppet on a specific node `n`
* `node_data` n: dynamic info from hiera for a specific node `n`
* `node_du` n: disk usage on a node
* `result` [i] : result of your last `i` command(s)
* `result_for` jid: result of a specific job specified by its `jid`
* `commands`:  list all possible salt execution commands (slow)
* `stats`: status of all the nodes
* `data_for` k : dynamic info given a specific key `k` across all nodes
* `ping_by`: ping all nodes by role


## Orchestration

Salt can run multiple commands as well using the orchestrate runner. The orchestration is executed on the salt master to allow inter minion requisites, like ordering the application of states on different minions that must not happen simultaneously, or for halting the state run on all minions if a minion fails one of its states (more about this topic can be found https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt5.html#orchestrate-runner[in the saltstack website]).

The orchestration should be defined in the orch folder. You will find some examples http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/MIDDLEWARE/repos/salt-stack-middleware/browse/orch?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fmiddleware[here].

Orchestrate commands can be started using:

```
→ cicd testing orch CMD
```

## TODO

- [] zsh completion
- [] in devbox, insert this README
- [] in devbox, update `language-puppet`
- [] re-use cicd in the console (cicd prod stack ping -> stack ping)
