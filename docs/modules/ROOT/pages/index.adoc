## Setup

To use the `cicd shell`, you need to fill in the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/config/shell[configuration file] located in `/vagrant/config/shell`.

The shell is installed with the devbox. On a different system, you can :

- <<_install_outside_the_devbox, Install outside the devbox>>
- <<_use_with_docker, Use the available docker>>


## Usage

The name of the command line utility is #cicd#. The first mandatory position argument is the zone (dev, testing, staging or prod).

.General scheme of the command line
[%autofit]
```
cicd ZONE facts                  [ROLE] [-n NODE] [-g GROUP] [-s STACK] [--all] [--down]
cicd ZONE runpuppet              [ROLE] [-n NODE] [-g GROUP] [-s STACK]
cicd ZONE service ACTION SERVICE [ROLE] [-n NODE] [-g GROUP] [-s STACK]
cicd ZONE orch    CMD                                        [-s STACK]
cicd ZONE result [-j JID] [-n NUM] [--raw]
cicd ZONE console

cicd doc (html | modules | mod MOD)
```

The auto-completion feature helps you to complete the command. You can also request the help at each level:

[NOTE]
====
- Commands are executed remotely through an API. Behind the scene they call either the `puppetdb`, the `saltmaster` or the `pgserver`.
- Commands to the saltmaster together with their results are recorded in a centralized database included the date and name of the person that executes them.
- By default, all commands target a specific default hostgroup/stack defined in `/vagrant/conf/shell`
====


### >_ facts

The command displays a subset of important facts (static information) about your nodes such as the `fqdn`, `ip`, `os`, `role`, ...

The facts are mostly static information. By default they are cached to give immediate feedback. To update the cache, use the `--refresh` flag.

You can toggle the `facts` query to target all hostgroups/stacks with the `--all` flag. Here is how to get all facts for all slaves in every stack:

```
λ ~ → cicd prod facts jenkins.slave --all
{
  "fqdn": "svappcavl736.prd.srv.cirb.lan",
  "ip": "192.168.34.52",
  "os": "RedHat 7.3",
  "hostgroup": "ci",
  "subgroup": "jenkins",
  "role": "slave",
  "instance": "middleware",
  "puppet run": "Mon Apr 16 11:33:41 CEST 2018",
  "jenkins job": "186"
}
{
  "fqdn": "svappcavl771.prd.srv.cirb.lan",
  "ip": "192.168.34.81",
  "os": "RedHat 7.4",
  "hostgroup": "ci",
  "subgroup": "jenkins",
  "role": "slave",
  "instance": "fmx",
  "puppet run": "Mon Apr 16 14:24:05 CEST 2018",
  "jenkins job": "188"
}
...
```
As usual, use `-n` to target a single node:
```
→ cicd prod facts -n svappcavl771.prd.srv.cirb.lan
{
  "fqdn": "svappcavl771.prd.srv.cirb.lan",
  "ip": "192.168.34.81",
  "os": "RedHat 7.4",
  "hostgroup": "ci",
  "subgroup": "jenkins",
  "role": "slave",
  "instance": "fmx",
  "puppet run": "Mon Apr 16 14:24:05 CEST 2018",
  "jenkins job": "188"
}
```

TIP:  Use the `--down` flag  to gather `facts` on a disconnected minion.


### >_ runpuppet

The command runs the puppet agent on one or multiple nodes. When a node is specified with `-n`, the command will wait back for a result.

```
→ cicd dev runpuppet -n svappcavl000.dev.srv.cirb.lan
```

If you need to pass the `--environment` to the `puppet agent` command you should specify the stack with the `-s` optionfootnote:[this might useful for the first 'runpuppet']. This will only work when targeting a single node :

```
→ result/bin/cicd dev runpuppet -n irisbox.dev.srv.cirb.lan -s irisbox --dry
pepper irisbox.dev.srv.cirb.lan -t 300 cicd.run_puppet zone=dev hostgroup=irisbox
```

On all other cases, the command first asks for confirmation, then returns quickly with a `jobid`.
The process is asynchronous because it might take quite a while to complete.

Here are some examples:

```
→ cicd dev runpuppet <1>
→ cicd dev runpuppet -g jenkins <2>
→ cicd dev runpuppet jenkins.slave --noop <3>
```
<1> run puppet on all the dev nodes of your stack
<2> run on a subgroup of machines
<3> target a role in `--noop` mode

In a second step, you use icon:terminal[] `result` to retrieve from the database the result of your callfootnote:[polling is currently the sole supported workflow, server push notification could be implemented in the future].

### >_ result

You can view the result of a `runpuppet` by using the provided job id (`jid`)
```
→ cicd testing result -j 20160621104434055991
```
In case the result is not yet available the command will automatically be retry 12 times (3 min).

IMPORTANT: The pretty printer is tailored to work on jobid coming from `icon:terminal[] runpuppet`. For all other JIDs, you should add the `--raw` flag.

You can also ask for the last n executed commands:
```
→ cicd testing result -n 2
```

### >_ service

To know if a service is up and running, you would use:
```
→ cicd prod service status docker jenkins.slave
{
  "svappcavl736.prd.srv.cirb.lan": true
}
```
You can also restart a service. However such operation in only allowed for a single machine. Here is how to restart the `nexus` service :
```
→ cicd prod service restart nexus -n svappcavl761.prd.srv.cirb.lan
{
  "svappcavl761.prd.srv.cirb.lan": true
}
```

### >_ du

The command displays disk usage. Try:
```
→ cicd staging du -n svappcavl703.sta.srv.cirb.lan
```

### >_ setfacts

To set (or update) the four basic `facts` on a specific machine:
```
→ cicd dev setfacts -n fqdn --subgroup jenkins --role slave --zone dev --hostgroup bas
```

You can of course update just one fact with:
```
→ cicd dev setfacts -n fqdn --subgroup jenkins2
```
NOTE: the `setfacts` subcommand always requires a target node (`-n`)


### >_ state

Apply a configuration (called 'state' in Salt) on one machine.

```
→ cicd dev state CMD -n NODE
```

This command target one single node for safety reasons. If you wish to target multiple nodes, use the equivalent `pep` command within the console:

```
[cicd dev]$ pep -C "G@subgroup:puppet and G@hostgroup:cicd" state.apply puppet4-agent
```

### >_ orch

Salt is able to orchestrate deployment scenarios across machines.

The orchestration is executed on the salt master to allow inter minion requisites, like ordering the application of states on different minions that must not happen simultaneously, or for halting the state run on all minions if a minion fails one of its states (more about this topic can be found https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/states_pt5.html#orchestrate-runner[in the saltstack website]).

To write some specific orchestration scripts for your stack, you need to request a salt stack repository. For `bos` it would be named `salt-stack-bos`. This process is similar to the creation of `puppet-stack-bos` . The scripts should sit in the `orch` folder. You can find some examples http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/MIDDLEWARE/repos/salt-stack-middleware/browse/orch?at=refs%2Fheads%2Fmiddleware[here].

Orchestrate commands are executed with:

```
→ cicd testing orch CMD
```

### >_ foreman

Open a browser and display the relevant foreman page related to your query. For instance to get a list of all jenkins slaves and the link to its complete report, type:

```
cicd prod foreman jenkins.slave -s ci
```

### >_ console

For longer session within a specific zone, you can save some typing by opening a `console` for that zone. Inside the console, you would omit the zone from the command line. Here is an example:

```
→ cicd staging console

[cicd staging]$ facts
```

Another usage of the console is to run specific `salt` commands that are not exposed by the `cicd` command line. This is done via the #pep# shortcut. For instance:

[%autofit]
```
$ pep -G 'hostgroup:iam' file.replace '/etc/resolv.conf' pattern='192.168.34.250' repl='192.168.34.244' <1>

$ pep -L fqdn1,fqdn2 --client=local_async cicd.run_agent <2>
```
<1> #-G# means `grain` target (__grains__ is the salt terminology for facts).
<2> #-L# means `list` target +
#local_asyn# means the command is asynchronous and does not display its result (just a jid)

[TIP]
====
- Have a look at the saltstack documentation to learn more about https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/#targeting-minions[targeting minions].
- Take a look https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/index.html#salt-module-reference[here] for a list of possible commands.
====

### >_ help

The `help` subcommand will open the guide in a browser, display the list of available salt module and show the help for each of them.

```
→ cicd doc
Usage: cicd doc (html | modules | mod)
  Documentation utilities

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text

Available commands:
  html                     Open the documentation in a browser
  modules                  Output all possible salt execution modules
  mod                      Doc about a specific salt module
```

### >_ pass

The `pass` subcommand is used to change the stored password. Handy whenever you change your AD password.

## Authentication
====
The permissions to target machines and perform actions are realized through our Active directory.
As an example to access the machines of the `irisbox` hostgroup, you will need to be part of the `GP_APP_SALT_IRISBOX` group.

These permissions should have been set for you already. If they don't, please contact the `cicd` team.
====

### AD password storage

The first time you use the `cicd-shell`, a prompt will ask you for your AD password.
This is required because every action realized is guarded by permission and recorded in database.

The prompt will propose you to store your password on the devbox.
Accept the proposition in order to avoid retyping your password for each subsequent actions.

Your password does not leave the devbox.
If you feel it might be in danger sitting in the devbox filesystem, you can add a level0 running script to remove the #.pwd# file when the devbox shutdowns.


## Use with docker

[lowerroman]
. Login to the Artifactory docker registry. This is mandatory for the first pulling of the image :
+
```
docker login cicd-docker.repository.irisnet.be <1>
```
<1> Use your encrypted artifactory password when prompted.

. To run the docker, you can copy/paste and adjust the content of http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/CICD/repos/cicd-shell/browse/docker/run.sh[docker/run.sh], make an alias or grep the whole script. Here is an example:
+
```
./docker/run.sh dev facts
```

## Install outside the devbox

Outside the devbox, you can either use the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager or docker. For docker, please read <<_use_with_docker, the above paragraph>>.

Installing `nix` is simple and safefootnote:[nix is completly self-contained and isolated from your OS]:

```
bash <(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

This will perform a single-user installation of nix, meaning that /nix is owned by the invoking user.
The script will only invoke `sudo` to create /nix if it doesn’t already exist. At that point, the script will prompt you for a password.
To later delete nix, just remove the `/nix` folder from your system.

To activate `nix` in your terminal, add the following line in your `.bash_profile`:

```
source ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
```

The second step is to configure `nix` to use the https://cachix.org[cachix] binary cache:

.Install cachix
```
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tarball/1d4de0d552ae9aa66a5b8dee5fb0650a4372d148
```

.Use it to configure ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```
cachix use cicd-shell
```

You can then proceed and install the `cicd-shell` with:

```
nix-env -i -f https://github.com/CIRB/cicd-shell/tarball/22f804994fe4233d875e792458fcda9a12e35faa
```

TIP: You might want to place the shell configuration file in `~/.config/cicd/shell.dhall` instead of `/vagrant/config/shell.dhall`.
